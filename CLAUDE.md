## MCP Server

An MCP server at `tools/mcp-server.mjs` exposes Tale UI's component registry and recipes as tools. Configured in `.mcp.json`.

**Tools:** `list_components`, `get_component`, `search_components`, `list_recipes`, `get_recipe`, `search_docs`

## CSS Design System (@tale-ui/core)

See [packages/css/CLAUDE.md](packages/css/CLAUDE.md) for the full CSS contributor guide.

## React Components (@tale-ui/react)

**Setup guide:** See [docs/react-setup.md](docs/react-setup.md) for the full consumer guide.

**Styling Architecture:** Components in `packages/react/src/{name}/{Component}.styled.tsx` apply BEM class names automatically. The CSS rules themselves live in `packages/styles/src/` — consumers still import `@tale-ui/react-styles` for the stylesheet. Override via additional `className` props.

**Component CSS pattern:**
```css
.tale-button { ... }
.tale-button--primary { ... }   /* variant */
.tale-button--sm { ... }        /* size modifier */
.tale-button[data-disabled] { opacity: 0.45; pointer-events: none; }
```

**State data attributes:** `data-disabled`, `data-open`, `data-selected`, `data-pressed`, `data-focus-visible`, `data-focused`, `data-hovered`, `data-entering`, `data-exiting`, `data-placement="top|bottom|left|right"`

### Design Tokens

All component styles use tokens from `@tale-ui/core`:
- **Colors:** `--neutral-*` and `--color-*` (NEVER `--brand-*` in component CSS)
- **Foreground:** `--color-*-fg` and `--neutral-*-fg` for auto-contrasting text on any shade background
- **Spacing:** `--space-4xs` through `--space-4xl`
- **Typography:** `--label-s-font-size`, `--text-s-font-size`, etc.
- **Dark mode:** Automatic via `data-color-mode="dark"` on `<html>`

**Available `--neutral-*` shades (27 values — irregular scale):**

```
5, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100
```

`--neutral-15` DOES NOT EXIST. `--neutral-25` DOES NOT EXIST. `--neutral-35` DOES NOT EXIST.

**Available `--color-*` shades (11 values — regular scale):**

```
5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
```

`--color-9` DOES NOT EXIST. `--color-55` DOES NOT EXIST. Same scale applies to `--brand-*`, `--red-*`, `--error-*`, etc.

**Foreground tokens:** Append `-fg` to any shade for auto-contrasting text: `--color-60-fg`, `--neutral-20-fg`

Full token reference: [packages/css/docs/ai-reference.md](packages/css/docs/ai-reference.md)

### Development Workflow

```bash
pnpm install                    # install all workspace deps
pnpm playground:dev             # run vite playground
pnpm build                      # build all packages (uses lerna)
pnpm test:jsdom                 # run unit tests in jsdom
pnpm test:chromium              # run tests in chromium
pnpm typescript                 # type check
pnpm eslint                     # lint JS/TS
pnpm lint:css                   # lint CSS design system
pnpm audit:bem              # verify BEM classes have matching CSS
pnpm audit:brand            # verify no --brand-* in component CSS
pnpm audit:docs             # verify docs list all component props
pnpm audit:components       # 19-check component completeness audit
pnpm registry:generate      # regenerate registry/components.json from source
pnpm registry:check         # verify registry is up-to-date (CI mode)
pnpm validate:generated     # validate generated .tsx against registry + tsc
pnpm golden:validate        # validate all golden prompt references
```

### Component source conventions

```
packages/react/src/{component}/
  {Component}.styled.tsx           — styled wrapper (applies BEM class names, wraps React Aria Components)
  {Component}.test.tsx            — unit tests
  {Component}.spec.tsx            — browser tests (optional)
  index.ts                        — public API re-export (re-exports from .styled.tsx)
```

`index.ts` exports the styled version. Import paths like `@tale-ui/react/button` resolve to the styled component.

### Component documentation

Every component has a usage guide at `docs/components/{name}.md` with imports, sub-parts, props, and examples. When adding a new component, you must also:
- Create `docs/components/{name}.md`
- Add the component name to `docs/consumer-claude-md-snippet.md` (the available components list)
- Add the component to the catalogue and per-component docs sections in `packages/react/README.md`

See [docs/authoring-components.md](docs/authoring-components.md) for the full checklist.

**When updating an existing component**, ensure all of the following are kept in sync:

- **Markdown docs** — update `docs/components/{name}.md` (props, parts, examples, CSS classes)
- **JSDoc** — update JSDoc comments on exported props/components in `{Component}.styled.tsx`
- **Code examples** — update any inline examples in docs and README to reflect the new API
- **Component Audit** — update `playground/vite-app/src/demos/ComponentAudit.tsx` to exercise the change
- **Storybook** — update or add stories in `playground/storybook/src/stories/{Component}.stories.tsx`

### Shared primitives (`_primitives.css`)

`packages/styles/src/_primitives.css` holds grouped selectors for declarations that are byte-for-byte identical across multiple components. When adding a new field-like input, dropdown popup, or list item — check `_primitives.css` first and add the new selector to the relevant group.

## Component Artifact Audit

Status of required artifacts for all 87 components. When adding or updating a component, update the relevant row below.

**Legend:** styled = `{Component}.styled.tsx` | index = `index.ts` | test = `{Component}.test.tsx` (non-trivial logic only) | css = `{component}.css` in styles/src | prim = `_primitives.css` entry (if shared declarations apply) | doc = `docs/components/{name}.md` | snip = consumer-claude-md-snippet.md | rdme = react/README.md | idx = `docs/component-index.md` entry | story = Storybook story | audit = ComponentAudit.tsx entry | a2ui = A2UI catalog adapter in `packages/a2ui/src/catalog.ts`

**✓** = present | **✗** = missing | **n/a** = not applicable

**Non-trivial components requiring tests:** Drawer (custom state/swipe), Meter (percentage calc), ProgressBar (percentage calc + indeterminate), ColorModeToggle (localStorage/OS preference), Tabs (MutationObserver/ResizeObserver indicator)

**Total:** 90 components | **Fully complete:** 90 | **Missing artifacts:** 0
